### Discovering Price Trends by Property Type

Our journey continues with a deeper look into price distributions by property type across top locations. This violin plot provides insights into how property prices vary for different types—whether it's an apartment, condo, or serviced residence. 

#### How to View This Plot:
- **Property Types:** The x-axis categorizes the properties into types such as Apartment, Condo, and Serviced Residence. Each category is represented by a distinct section on the plot.
- **Price Distribution:** The y-axis shows the price range. The shape of each violin indicates the distribution of prices within each property type. A wider section of the violin indicates a higher concentration of properties at that price range.
- **Color Coding:** Different colors represent different locations. This helps you compare how the price distributions for each property type vary across various locations.
- **Box Plot and Points:** The plot includes a box plot within each violin, providing a summary of the central tendency and spread of prices. Individual data points are also shown, allowing you to see the exact price of each property.
- **Insights:** By examining the shape and spread of the violins, you can identify which property types offer the best value and how they compare across different areas. Look for patterns or clusters that indicate more affordable or premium options.

Explore this plot to understand the price dynamics of various property types and how they differ by location. This will help you identify which property types are more cost-effective and where you might find the best deals.
